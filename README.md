# LaziestBastard

- Start the game with the minimum needed to win with ZERO handcrafts
- Use your crashed ship machinery to start automating early, improvised and slow but truely lazy

- Disables handcrafting (can be re-enabled in "/permissions")
- Better map pollution cloud visibility

- Also serves as a personal QoL modpack
