# LaziestBastard

- Use your crashed ship machinery to start automating as soon as you land. Slow and improvised but truly lazy!
- Start the game with the minimum needed to win with ZERO handcrafts
- Better map pollution cloud visibility
- Also serves as a personal QoL modpack

(Handcrafting can be re-enabled in the "/permissions" menu)
